## üéØ **What Was Added**

Comprehensive information about the competitive loot pool, optimal loadout strategies, and the complete O.X.R. ranking system has been integrated into your AI coaching system. This includes weapon priorities, mobility combinations, healing strategies, and detailed ranking mechanics for all game modes.

## üî´ **Competitive Loot Pool & Loadout Strategy**

### **Primary Weapons**

#### **Shotgun Options**
**Sentinel Pump:**
- **Status:** Best shotgun option for competitive
- **Advantage:** Reliable and consistent performance
- **Usage:** Primary close-range weapon

**Wrecker Revolver:**
- **Status:** Potential shotgun replacement
- **Meta Note:** Players might take this and no shotgun
- **Recommendation:** Test this yourself to get used to it
- **Future:** Wait to see which is better in the next few days

**Mythic Sweeper:**
- **Status:** Good because it's mythic, not necessarily better than pump
- **Usage:** Reliable close-range option with enhanced stats

#### **Assault Rifle Options**
**For Stacked Lobbies:**
- **O.X.R. Rifle:** High-priority for surge mechanics
- **DMR:** Alternative for surge mechanics

### **Mobility Items**
**Primary:** Crash Pads (no slow gliding problems)
**Backup:** Launch Pads if you don't get crash pads
