### üéØ Landing Strategy Based on POI Data

#### **Aggressive Players (High Competition)**
- Target **Martial Maneuvers, Rocky Rus, Swarmy Stash** for high loot potential
- Expect 1.24 avg teams but high survival rate (62%)
- High metal availability (1600) for building-intensive playstyles

#### **Passive Players (Low Competition)**
- Land at **Fighting Frogs, First Order Base** for minimal early fights
- Lower loot (38) but very low competition (0.48 avg teams)
- Good for survival-focused gameplay

#### **Resource-Focused Players**
- **First Order Base** offers 10,000 metal (highest in dataset)
- **Rogue Slurp Room Market** provides 9600 metal
- **Crabby Cove** offers 9300 metal with low competition

#### **Zone-Aware Landing**
- **Zone 1-3:** Focus on guaranteed coverage areas using zone prediction mechanics
- **Zone 4-6:** Consider Rift Island mechanics when choosing landing spots
- **Late Zones:** Prioritize survival rate over loot quantity

## Advanced Zone Prediction & Mechanics

### üîÅ The Double Pull Phenomenon
When Zone 1 appears near the edge or corner of the map, Zone 2 has an 85% chance to continue in the same direction. This creates the "Double Pull" effect where players feel forced to keep running.

**Zone 2 Prediction Stats (when Zone 1 is near edge):**
- Far zone (continues direction): 63%
- Slightly toward edge: 22%
- Pulls back a little: 10%
- Pulls back a lot: 5%

### üß† Guaranteed Zone Strategy
**Zone Dimensions & Guaranteed Coverage:**
- Zone 1: 2400m wide
- Zone 2: 1900m wide
- Zone 2 must be fully inside Zone 1

**Strategic Positioning:**
- Position in the center of Zone 1 (dark green area) = guaranteed to be in Zone 2
- This central position is also guaranteed to be in Zone 3
- Result: No movement needed until Zone 4

### üèù Rift Island & Zone 6 Mechanics
**Rift Island Behavior:**
- Spawns during Zone 4, always inside Zone 4
- Often in Zone 5, but not guaranteed
- Actively avoids Zone 6

**Zone 6 Avoidance Stats:**
- Normal chance of Rift Island being in Zone 6: 25%
- Due to avoidance logic: 6%
- Chapter 4: Nearly 0% (1 in 10,000 games)
- Note: No effect on Zones 7-12

**Strategic Insight:** If Rift Island is near Zone 5 edge, Zone 6 is 4x less likely in that direction.

### üåä Ocean Zone Restrictions
- Zone centers cannot be over the ocean
- Epic draws coastline boundaries to prevent water zone centers
- If Zone 5 is near map edge, Zone 6 will not pull toward ocean

### üö´ Blacklisted Areas
- Chapters 3, 4, and 5 had certain "blacklisted" areas
- Zones couldn't spawn in these locations
- Currently: No blacklisted areas (subject to change in updates)

### ü¶ô Llamas & Zone Prediction (Chapter 2 Remix)
**Llama Mechanics:**
- Always spawn in the next unseen zone
- Spotting a Llama reveals the next zone location
- Works at all game stages
- Currently not in tournaments

**Example:** Llama in Zone 1 = Zone 2 location revealed

### ‚ùå Debunked Zone Myths
**False Beliefs:**
- Zones intentionally go over mountains
- Zones intentionally go over water
- Zones favor new POIs
- Moving zones follow "pull back, pull forward, pull back" pattern
- Zones were rigged for specific players

### üìä Zone Prediction Strategy Summary
1. **Land Assessment:** Check Zone 1 position relative to map edges
2. **Double Pull:** If Zone 1 is near edge, expect Zone 2 to continue that direction
3. **Center Positioning:** Use guaranteed coverage areas for strategic advantage
4. **Rift Island:** Monitor for Zone 6 avoidance patterns
5. **Ocean Awareness:** Zones won't center over water
6. **Llama Intel:** Use for next zone prediction when available

## Basic Zone Management

### Zone Types
- **Safe Zone:** The playable area that shrinks over time
- **Storm:** Damaging area outside the safe zone
- **Moving Zone:** Final zones that move to force player engagement

### Zone Timing
- **Zone 1:** 3 minutes
- **Zone 2:** 2 minutes 30 seconds
- **Zone 3:** 2 minutes
- **Zone 4:** 1 minute 45 seconds
- **Zone 5:** 1 minute 30 seconds
- **Final Zones:** 1 minute each

### Rotation Strategies
- **Early Game:** Focus on looting and positioning
- **Mid Game:** Use guaranteed zone areas for strategic advantage
- **Late Game:** Adapt to moving zones and final circle predictions

### Building for Zones
- **Zone 1-3:** Build bases in guaranteed coverage areas
- **Zone 4-6:** Prepare for potential Rift Island mechanics
- **Final Zones:** Build for mobility and quick rotations

- Target lower-ranked players for easier points
- Complete basic objectives (chests, supply drops)

**Mid Game (Ranks B-A):**
- Balance eliminations with survival
- Target bug spawners and hive stashes
- Coordinate with team for POI attacks

**Late Game (Ranks A-S+):**
- Focus on high-value eliminations
- Target Queen elimination (650 pts)
- Maximize storm survival points
- Coordinate team actions for maximum efficiency

### ‚è∞ **Final Queue Timing Strategy**

#### **Queue Timing Windows**
**xx:40-xx:45 Games:**
- **Risk:** High chance of being "keyed" off spawn (hard w-keying)
- **Reward:** Endgame will be more dead, easier placement
- **Strategy:** Land safe, hide from keyers, survive to endgame

**xx:45-xx:52 Games:**
- **Risk:** Heavy keying in first 5 minutes
- **Reward:** Passive mid-game, steady player count decline
- **Strategy:** Survive initial chaos, then play for placement

**Final 10 Minutes:**
- **Risk:** More stacked lobbies throughout
- **Reward:** Less keying off spawn
- **Strategy:** Better for players close to qualifying

#### **When to Queue for Last Game**
**Safe Landing Strategy (xx:40-xx:50):**
- Higher chance of being keyed off spawn
- Endgame will be more dead
- **Best for:** Players who can land safe and avoid keyers

**Stacked Game Strategy (Final 10 minutes):**
- Less keying off spawn
- More stacked throughout
- **Best for:** Players close to qualifying who need consistent performance

### üéÆ **Tournament Decision Making**

#### **Staying in Game vs. Final Queue**
**Key Questions to Ask:**
1. **Points Potential:** How many points can I gain in 2 more minutes?
   - Moving zones = high potential
   - 1st zone = low potential
2. **Points Needed:** How many points do I need to qualify?
   - Few points needed = worth staying
   - Many points needed = leave and key final game

#### **Key Game vs. Stacked Game Decision**
**Key Game Advantages:**
- Avoid really busy map areas
- Get "free" placement points
- Less stacked endgames
- No surge concerns

**Stacked Game Reality:**
- You won't drop down enough in 10-15 minutes for significant difference
- **Recommendation:** Load into key game, avoid busy areas

#### **W-Key Game Decision Factors**
**Stay in Game If:**
- Good loot available
- Haven't earned placement points yet
- Need few points to qualify
- Can survive with current loot

**Leave Game If:**
- Poor loot situation
- Need many points (40+) to qualify
- High risk of early death

### ü§º **Points-Based Matchmaking (PBMM)**

#### **How PBMM Works**
**Two-Sided Magnet Effect:**
- **Doing Badly:** Get easier lobbies, move up leaderboard
- **Doing Well:** Get harder lobbies, likely to drop back down
- **True Ability:** PBMM pulls you toward your actual skill level

#### **Tournament Timing Strategy**
**Last Hour Importance:**
- **Most critical time** of every tournament
- **Final game** is especially crucial
- **Advantage:** Less time for PBMM to pull you back down
- **Risk:** Bad final game = no recovery chances

**Mental Strategy:**
- Don't get discouraged by poor first 1-2 hours
- Good final hour can change everything
- Never play aggressive in final game unless necessary
- Focus on survival and placement in final game

### ‚è∞ **Starting Late Strategy**

#### **Statistical Reality**
**No Advantage/Disadvantage:**
- Teams starting up to 30 minutes late have identical expected results
- Late start doesn't provide competitive edge

#### **Starting Late Considerations**
**Advantages:**
- Easier first lobby on average
- Better chance of big win and elims
- Mental boost from starting with victory
- Extra game available during tournament

**Disadvantages:**
- "Lose" time not playing
- First game finishes after everyone else
- RNG still exists in first game

#### **When Starting Late is Bad**
**Avoid Late Start If:**
- Placement points are extremely important
- Need maximum endgame opportunities
- System requires playing as many endgames as possible

#### **PBMM Balance**
**Why Late Start Doesn't Work:**
- Easier first game is offset by PBMM
- Harder subsequent games wipe out advantage
- Everyone else already has points
- No lasting competitive edge

## Zone Prediction & Strategic Positioning

### The Double Pull Counter-Strategy
When you land and see Zone 1 near an edge:
1. **Immediate Assessment:** Zone 2 will likely continue that direction (85% chance)
2. **Strategic Response:** Position yourself in the guaranteed center area of Zone 1
3. **Result:** You won't need to move until Zone 4, giving you massive strategic advantage

### Guaranteed Zone Positioning
**Zone 1-3 Strategy:**
- Land in Zone 1 center (2400m wide)
- Build your base in the guaranteed coverage area (1900m wide)
- This area is guaranteed to be in Zone 2 AND Zone 3
- Use this time to gather resources, heal, and prepare for later zones

**Zone 4-6 Strategy:**
- Monitor Rift Island spawn location
- If Rift Island is near Zone 5 edge, Zone 6 is 4x less likely in that direction
- Position yourself accordingly for Zone 6 prediction

### Advanced Rotation Planning
**Early Game (Zones 1-3):**
- Use guaranteed zone areas to avoid unnecessary movement
- Focus on resource gathering and base building
- Monitor player count and adjust aggression level

**Mid Game (Zones 4-6):**
- Adapt to Rift Island mechanics
- Use ocean zone restrictions to predict safe areas
- Position for final zone predictions

**Late Game (Zones 7+):**
- Rift Island has no effect on final zones
- Focus on mobility and quick rotations
- Use natural cover and high ground

## Box Fighting
- Build a 1x1 box when under pressure
- Edit walls to create shooting angles
- Use cones to block enemy edits
- Place traps strategically in corners

## High Ground Retakes
- Thwifo cone technique for quick elevation
- Side jump + ramp for lateral movement
- Double ramp + wall for protection
- Use launch pads or shockwaves when available

## Team Fighting
- Coordinate builds with teammates
- Use different materials to avoid confusion
- Communicate rotations and enemy positions
- Share resources and healing items

## End Game Tactics
- Stay in the center of safe zones
- Use natural cover when possible
- Conserve materials for final fights
- Stay mobile to avoid being pinched
- Use utility items strategically (shockwaves, launch pads)

## Zone-Aware Combat
- Fight near zone edges to force opponents into storm
- Use zone mechanics to predict enemy rotations
- Position yourself in guaranteed coverage areas during fights
