## üèÜ COMPREHENSIVE TOURNAMENT STRATEGY & IMPROVEMENT GUIDE

### üéØ DUO PREPARATION & ROLE SELECTION

#### **Role-Based Stat Analysis**

**‚û°Ô∏è FRAGGERS - Key Stats to Evaluate:**
- **Damage Dealt**: Compare to teammates - fraggers should almost always have more damage than their IGL
- **Damage Ratio**: Under 1.0 is concerning, but can happen with best fraggers in hard lobbies
- **Tournament Consistency**: Check stats over multiple tournaments, not just one
- **Leaderboard Position**: Verify they were high/low consistently across tournaments

**‚û°Ô∏è IGLs (In-Game Leaders) - Key Stats to Evaluate:**
- **Damage Ratio**: More important than total damage for IGLs
- **Fighting Ability**: Good damage ratio proves they can fight when needed
- **Decision Making**: Cannot be measured in stats - comes from VOD review
- **Tarp Quality**: Cannot be measured in stats - comes from gameplay analysis

**‚ùå STATS THAT DON'T MATTER FOR ROLE SELECTION:**
- **Builds Placed**: Meaningless for determining skill level
- **Mats Farmed**: Doesn't indicate strategic value
- **Total Damage (for IGLs)**: Getting lots of damage isn't the IGL's role

#### **LFG Post Optimization**

**‚úÖ ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS FOR GOOD LFG POSTS:**

**1. Show You're Worth Playing With:**
- Introduce yourself properly
- Demonstrate motivation to work hard together
- Show commitment to improvement

**2. Realistic PR Requirements:**
- If you have 400 PR, don't say "LFD 500+ PR"
- Use range: "300-500 PR" instead of minimums
- Prevents mismatches and expands your pool

**3. Optimal Length:**
- Not too long: Avoid ChatGPT-style lists with 100 requirements
- Not too short: Include essential info (roles, languages, PR)
- Be specific but concise

**‚úÖ EXAMPLE OF GOOD LFG POST:**
"LFD. I'm an EU IGL with 500 PR who is really motivated to improve. I'm looking for a crazy fragger with similar PR who can play scrims most days. Speak English/German."

**‚ùå AVOID THESE MISTAKES:**
- Generic requirements everyone knows
- Unrealistic PR expectations
- Missing essential information
- Overly long requirement lists

### üìö STRUCTURED TRAINING PLAN (10-20-30-40 RULE)

#### **Weekly Time Allocation Strategy**

**10% - VOD Pros**
- Watch players who land at your dropspot
- Study how they fight off spawn and rotate out
- Analyze recent tournament winners
- Watch educational videos about pro victories
- Focus on specific aspects: rotations, fights, decision-making

**20% - VOD Yourself**
- Review after each tournament (1 hour minimum)
- Find mistakes that caused deaths
- Write down specific errors and solutions
- Track improvement over time
- Focus on decision-making patterns

**30% - Scrims**
- Get to know teammates well
- Improve endgame scenarios significantly
- Practice team coordination
- If no team: reduce scrimming, increase individual practice
- Focus on competitive scenarios

**40% - Creative Training**
- 1v1s, 2v2s, boxfights
- Solo mechanics training
- Build/edit accuracy practice
- Go slow sometimes for precision
- Focus on mechanical improvement

#### **EXAMPLE WEEKLY SCHEDULE (10 Hours Available):**
- **1 hour**: VOD pros
- **2 hours**: VOD yourself  
- **3 hours**: Scrims
- **4 hours**: Creative training

#### **RANKED/RELOAD INTEGRATION:**
- **Not part of official improvement time**
- Use for relaxation after focused training
- Play with friends casually
- Don't require full concentration
- Other 4 activities are far more important

### üó∫Ô∏è DROPSPOT ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

#### **The "Best Dropspot" Formula**

**Key Factors to Balance:**
1. **Loot Quality** - Higher loot = better gear
2. **Contest Level** - More contested = higher risk
3. **Materials Available** - Especially metal for building
4. **Survival Rate** - Chances of surviving off spawn
5. **Loot Splitting** - Probability of sharing with other teams

#### **Dropspot Comparison Framework**

**Example Analysis: The Hive vs Demons**
- **The Hive**: 81 loot, 1.15 avg teams, 600 metal, 54% survival
- **Demons**: 74 loot, 1.34 avg teams, 500 metal, 53% survival
- **Winner**: The Hive (better across all metrics)

**Example Analysis: The Hive vs Shining Span**
- **The Hive**: 81 loot, 1.15 avg teams, 600 metal, 54% survival
- **Shining Span**: 40 loot, 1.01 avg teams, 2600 metal, 66% survival
- **Decision**: Depends on playstyle (loot vs survival vs materials)

#### **Overall Rating System**
- Combines all 4 metrics into single score
- Ranks dropspots objectively
- Accounts for personal preferences
- Provides shortlist of best options

#### **Current Season Dropspot Intelligence**

**üü¢ RECOMMENDED DROPSPOTS:**
- **Mountain West of Demon's**: 80% survival rate in EU Div 3
- **Half games uncon**: Excellent for spawn survival
- **Low contest**: Minimal early fights

**üî¥ AVOID THESE DROPSPOTS:**
- **Supernova Academy**: 
  - Bad loot unless golden POI with drones
  - Overcontested (1.69 avg teams)
  - High risk, low reward

**‚ö†Ô∏è PREVIOUSLY GOOD DROPSPOTS (Now Contested):**
- **Outpost**: Getting much more contested this season
- **First Order**: No longer safe, higher competition

#### **Dropspot Selection Strategy**
1. **Personal Preference**: POIs vs center map vs edge
2. **Playstyle Match**: Aggressive vs passive vs balanced
3. **Tournament Format**: Different strategies for different formats
4. **Team Composition**: Fragger/IGL landing preferences
5. **Meta Considerations**: Current season changes

### üéÆ ADVANCED COMPETITIVE INSIGHTS

#### **Landing Priority**
- **Land First = Win Off Spawn 90% of the time**
- **Dropmap Strategy**: Essential for consistent landing
- **Spawn Control**: Critical for tournament success

#### **Tournament Preparation**
- **Solid Plan Required**: Never go into games without strategy
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Use actual tournament data
- **Community Advantage**: Access to premium analysis tools
- **Consistent Results**: Proven track record of improvements

#### **Meta Evolution Awareness**
- **Season Changes**: Dropspots change in popularity
- **Contest Level Shifts**: Previously safe spots become contested
- **Loot Updates**: POI changes affect viability
- **Stay Updated**: Regular analysis prevents outdated strategies

## Advanced Zone Prediction & Mechanics

### üîÅ The Double Pull Phenomenon
When Zone 1 appears near the edge or corner of the map, Zone 2 has an 85% chance to continue in the same direction. This creates the "Double Pull" effect where players feel forced to keep running.

**Zone 2 Prediction Stats (when Zone 1 is near edge):**
- Far zone (continues direction): 63%
- Slightly toward edge: 22%
- Pulls back a little: 10%
- Pulls back a lot: 5%

### üß† Guaranteed Zone Strategy
**Zone Dimensions & Guaranteed Coverage:**
- Zone 1: 2400m wide
- Zone 2: 1900m wide
- Zone 2 must be fully inside Zone 1

**Strategic Positioning:**
- Position in the center of Zone 1 (dark green area) = guaranteed to be in Zone 2
- This central position is also guaranteed to be in Zone 3
- Result: No movement needed until Zone 4

### üèù Rift Island & Zone 6 Mechanics
**Rift Island Behavior:**
- Spawns during Zone 4, always inside Zone 4
- Often in Zone 5, but not guaranteed
- Actively avoids Zone 6

**Zone 6 Avoidance Stats:**
- Normal chance of Rift Island being in Zone 6: 25%
- Due to avoidance logic: 6%
- Chapter 4: Nearly 0% (1 in 10,000 games)
- Note: No effect on Zones 7-12

**Strategic Insight:** If Rift Island is near Zone 5 edge, Zone 6 is 4x less likely in that direction.

### üåä Ocean Zone Restrictions
- Zone centers cannot be over the ocean
- Epic draws coastline boundaries to prevent water zone centers
- If Zone 5 is near map edge, Zone 6 will not pull toward ocean

### üö´ Blacklisted Areas
- Chapters 3, 4, and 5 had certain "blacklisted" areas
- Zones couldn't spawn in these locations
- Currently: No blacklisted areas (subject to change in updates)

### ü¶ô Llamas & Zone Prediction (Chapter 2 Remix)
**Llama Mechanics:**
- Always spawn in the next unseen zone
- Spotting a Llama reveals the next zone location
- Works at all game stages
- Currently not in tournaments

**Example:** Llama in Zone 1 = Zone 2 location revealed

### ‚ùå Debunked Zone Myths
**False Beliefs:**
- Zones intentionally go over mountains
- Zones intentionally go over water
- Zones favor new POIs
- Moving zones follow "pull back, pull forward, pull back" pattern
- Zones were rigged for specific players

### üìä Zone Prediction Strategy Summary
1. **Land Assessment:** Check Zone 1 position relative to map edges
2. **Double Pull:** If Zone 1 is near edge, expect Zone 2 to continue that direction
3. **Center Positioning:** Use guaranteed coverage areas for strategic advantage
4. **Rift Island:** Monitor for Zone 6 avoidance patterns
5. **Ocean Awareness:** Zones won't center over water
6. **Llama Intel:** Use for next zone prediction when available

## Basic Zone Management

### Zone Types
- **Safe Zone:** The playable area that shrinks over time
- **Storm:** Damaging area outside the safe zone
- **Moving Zone:** Final zones that move to force player engagement

### Zone Timing
- **Zone 1:** 3 minutes
- **Zone 2:** 2 minutes 30 seconds
- **Zone 3:** 2 minutes
- **Zone 4:** 1 minute 45 seconds
- **Zone 5:** 1 minute 30 seconds
- **Final Zones:** 1 minute each

### Rotation Strategies
- **Early Game:** Focus on looting and positioning
- **Mid Game:** Use guaranteed zone areas for strategic advantage
- **Late Game:** Adapt to moving zones and final circle predictions

### Building for Zones
- **Zone 1-3:** Build bases in guaranteed coverage areas
- **Zone 4-6:** Prepare for potential Rift Island mechanics
- **Final Zones:** Build for mobility and quick rotations

## Tournament Strategy & Trio Surge Mechanics

### üêõ **QUEUE BUG WARNING - CRITICAL TOURNAMENT ISSUE** üêõ

**The Infinite Queue Bug:**
There is a critical bug where you queue for way too long and never get a game. This affects Div Cups and potentially other tournaments.

**How to Identify the Bug:**
You won't know you have it until you've been queueing "too long" - there's no visual indicator.

**Queue Time Limits by Division:**
- **Div 1:** 6 minutes maximum
- **Div 2:** 2 minutes maximum  
- **Div 3:** 6 minutes maximum
- **Other tournaments:** 6 minutes maximum

**The Fix:**
If you exceed these time limits, you MUST re-queue (unready and ready again). This is the only known solution.

**Why This Matters:**
- You'll never get into a game if you have the bug
- Wastes precious tournament time
- Can cost you qualification chances
- Affects all divisions but Div 2 is most sensitive (2 min vs 6 min)

### üéØ **Trio Surge - Chapter 6 Season 1**
**Player Count by Zone:**
- **Zones 2-3:** 90 players
- **Zone 4:** 78 players
- **Zone 5:** 63 players
- **Zone 6:** 54 players
- **Zone 7:** 42 players
- **Zone 8:** 39 players
- **Zones 9-12:** 30 players

### üèÜ **Current Tournament Schedule & Formats**

#### **FNCS Divisional Practice Cups (Trios)**
- **Duration:** 3 weeks until Globals
- **Format:** Same as previous divisional cups
- **Purpose:** Practice and preparation for major tournaments

### üìä **Tournament Qualification Points & Targets**

#### **Division 1 Qualification Targets**
**Day 1 Top 33:** 315-340 points (aim for 300+ to stay competitive)
**Day 1 Top 100:** 205-240 points
**Example Performance:** 1 Win (10 elims) + 2 Top 5s (6 elims) + 4 Top 10s (4 elims) + 3 spare games

#### **Division 2 Qualification Targets**  
**Day 1 Top 40:** 325-355 points (aim for 280+ to stay competitive)
**Day 1 Top 100:** 280-310 points
**Day 1 Top 200:** 235-275 points
**Day 1 Top 500:** 194-200 points
**Example Performance:** 2 Wins (9 elims) + 2 Top 5s (6 elims) + 3 Top 10s (3 elims) + 3 spare games

#### **Division 3 Qualification Targets**
**Day 1 Top 200:** 275-295 points (aim for 250+ to stay competitive)
**Day 1 Top 1000:** 225-260 points  
**Day 1 Top 2500:** 160-230 points
**Day 1 Top 7500:** 150 points
**Example Performance:** 1 Win (9 elims) + 2 Top 5s (6 elims) + 4 Top 10s (3 elims) + 3 spare games

**Important Note:** These are estimates to keep you on-track for qualification. If you don't reach them, get as close as possible - you can catch up on Day 2.

#### **Duos Divisional Cups**
- **Timing:** After Globals, during September+October
- **Divisions:** 5 for EU/NAC, 3 for other regions
- **Seeding:**
  - **Div 1:** Seeded from current Div 1 players (likely need Grands qualification or recent Div Cup success)
  - **Other Divs:** Seeded from TRIAL tournament
- **Promotion:** Every session (twice per week) instead of cumulative weekly
- **Note:** This doesn't mean permanent shift to Duos - likely temporary until Chapter 7

#### **Solo Series**
- **Frequency:** 1 tournament per week
- **Timing:** Uncertain if starts immediately or after Globals
- **Format:** Single round tournament with no divisions
- **Scoring:** Best 4 scores out of 6 weeks count toward final ranking
- **Qualification:** Top 100 players qualify for Final with cash prizes
- **Purpose:** Replacement for Solo Cash Cups with anti-cheat measures
- **Strategy:** Important for proving yourself with good placements even without Final qualification

#### **Reload Quick Cups**
- **Round 1:** 3 matches, best score counts
- **Qualification:** Win with 5+ elims = top group Round 2
- **Alternative:** Can still play lower group Round 2
- **Round 2:** Sum of points from 3 games
- **Before Globals:** Branded as skin cups, cosmetics for top teams
- **After Globals:** Set-lobby final for Top 20 teams with cash prizes

#### **üèÜ ACES WILD CARD FNCS CUP üèÜ**
**No region lock**

**üìä Points System / Format üìä**
- **10th = 1 point**
- **1 point per placement after that, so Win = 10 points**
- **Elim = 1 point**
- **Elim cap of 5 elims (very low)**
- **Basically you need to play placement. If you win, you'll probably naturally get those 5 elims anyway.**

**Round 1:**
- **3 games and 45 minutes** - That's enough time to play the first 2 games fully then queue for a 3rd before queues close
- **No elo**
- **Best game counts** - Only your best game matters
- **15 points to get into Round 2 Group 1** - The only way to do that is to win with 5+ elims
- **10+ points to get into Round 2 Group 2**
- **1+ point to get into Round 2 Group 3**
- **If you get 0 points in all 3 games you're finished**

**Round 2:**
- **3 games and 45 minutes**
- **No elo**
- **All games count** - So maximize your placement in all of them!
- **Only Group 1 players can win the skin**

- Complete basic objectives (chests, supply drops)

**Mid Game (Ranks B-A):**
- Balance eliminations with survival
- Target bug spawners and hive stashes
- Coordinate with team for POI attacks

**Late Game (Ranks A-S+):**
- Focus on high-value eliminations
- Target Queen elimination (650 pts)
- Maximize storm survival points
- Coordinate team actions for maximum efficiency

### ‚è∞ **Final Queue Timing Strategy**

#### **Queue Timing Windows**
**xx:40-xx:45 Games:**
- **Risk:** High chance of being "keyed" off spawn (hard w-keying)
- **Reward:** Endgame will be more dead, easier placement
- **Strategy:** Land safe, hide from keyers, survive to endgame

**xx:45-xx:52 Games:**
- **Risk:** Heavy keying in first 5 minutes
- **Reward:** Passive mid-game, steady player count decline
- **Strategy:** Survive initial chaos, then play for placement

**Final 10 Minutes:**
- **Risk:** More stacked lobbies throughout
- **Reward:** Less keying off spawn
- **Strategy:** Better for players close to qualifying

#### **When to Queue for Last Game**
**Safe Landing Strategy (xx:40-xx:50):**
- Higher chance of being keyed off spawn
- Endgame will be more dead
- **Best for:** Players who can land safe and avoid keyers

**Stacked Game Strategy (Final 10 minutes):**
- Less keying off spawn
- More stacked throughout
- **Best for:** Players close to qualifying who need consistent performance

### üéÆ **Tournament Decision Making**

#### **Staying in Game vs. Final Queue**
**Key Questions to Ask:**
1. **Points Potential:** How many points can I gain in 2 more minutes?
   - Moving zones = high potential
   - 1st zone = low potential
2. **Points Needed:** How many points do I need to qualify?
   - Few points needed = worth staying
   - Many points needed = leave and key final game

#### **Key Game vs. Stacked Game Decision**
**Key Game Advantages:**
- Avoid really busy map areas
- Get "free" placement points
- Less stacked endgames
- No surge concerns

**Stacked Game Reality:**
- You won't drop down enough in 10-15 minutes for significant difference
- **Recommendation:** Load into key game, avoid busy areas

#### **W-Key Game Decision Factors**
**Stay in Game If:**
- Good loot available
- Haven't earned placement points yet
- Need few points to qualify
- Can survive with current loot

**Leave Game If:**
- Poor loot situation
- Need many points (40+) to qualify
- High risk of early death

### ü§º **Points-Based Matchmaking (PBMM)**

#### **How PBMM Works**
**Two-Sided Magnet Effect:**
- **Doing Badly:** Get easier lobbies, move up leaderboard
- **Doing Well:** Get harder lobbies, likely to drop back down
- **True Ability:** PBMM pulls you toward your actual skill level

#### **Tournament Timing Strategy**
**Last Hour Importance:**
- **Most critical time** of every tournament
- **Final game** is especially crucial
- **Advantage:** Less time for PBMM to pull you back down
- **Risk:** Bad final game = no recovery chances

**Mental Strategy:**
- Don't get discouraged by poor first 1-2 hours
- Good final hour can change everything
- Never play aggressive in final game unless necessary
- Focus on survival and placement in final game

### ‚è∞ **Starting Late Strategy**

#### **Statistical Reality**
**No Advantage/Disadvantage:**
- Teams starting up to 30 minutes late have identical expected results
- Late start doesn't provide competitive edge

#### **Starting Late Considerations**
**Advantages:**
- Easier first lobby on average
- Better chance of big win and elims
- Mental boost from starting with victory
- Extra game available during tournament

**Disadvantages:**
- "Lose" time not playing
- First game finishes after everyone else
- RNG still exists in first game

#### **When Starting Late is Bad**
**Avoid Late Start If:**
- Placement points are extremely important
- Need maximum endgame opportunities
- System requires playing as many endgames as possible

#### **PBMM Balance**
**Why Late Start Doesn't Work:**
- Easier first game is offset by PBMM
- Harder subsequent games wipe out advantage
- Everyone else already has points
- No lasting competitive edge

## Zone Prediction & Strategic Positioning

### The Double Pull Counter-Strategy
When you land and see Zone 1 near an edge:
1. **Immediate Assessment:** Zone 2 will likely continue that direction (85% chance)
2. **Strategic Response:** Position yourself in the guaranteed center area of Zone 1
3. **Result:** You won't need to move until Zone 4, giving you massive strategic advantage

### Guaranteed Zone Positioning
**Zone 1-3 Strategy:**
- Land in Zone 1 center (2400m wide)
- Build your base in the guaranteed coverage area (1900m wide)
- This area is guaranteed to be in Zone 2 AND Zone 3
- Use this time to gather resources, heal, and prepare for later zones

**Zone 4-6 Strategy:**
- Monitor Rift Island spawn location
- If Rift Island is near Zone 5 edge, Zone 6 is 4x less likely in that direction
- Position yourself accordingly for Zone 6 prediction

### Advanced Rotation Planning
**Early Game (Zones 1-3):**
- Use guaranteed zone areas to avoid unnecessary movement
- Focus on resource gathering and base building
- Monitor player count and adjust aggression level

**Mid Game (Zones 4-6):**
- Adapt to Rift Island mechanics
- Use ocean zone restrictions to predict safe areas
- Position for final zone predictions

**Late Game (Zones 7+):**
- Rift Island has no effect on final zones
- Focus on mobility and quick rotations
- Use natural cover and high ground

## Box Fighting
- Build a 1x1 box when under pressure
- Edit walls to create shooting angles
- Use cones to block enemy edits
- Place traps strategically in corners

## High Ground Retakes
- Thwifo cone technique for quick elevation
- Side jump + ramp for lateral movement
- Double ramp + wall for protection
- Use launch pads or shockwaves when available

## Team Fighting
- Coordinate builds with teammates
- Use different materials to avoid confusion
- Communicate rotations and enemy positions
- Share resources and healing items

## End Game Tactics
- Stay in the center of safe zones
- Use natural cover when possible
- Conserve materials for final fights
- Stay mobile to avoid being pinched
- Use utility items strategically (shockwaves, launch pads)

## Zone-Aware Combat
- Fight near zone edges to force opponents into storm
- Use zone mechanics to predict enemy rotations
- Position yourself in guaranteed coverage areas during fights

## üèÜ Reload Icon Cup Strategy Tips üèÜ
- **Points fluctuate** during tournaments - monitor live updates
- **Queue bugs** can lower point thresholds by 10-15 points

## üèóÔ∏è Endgame Layer Strategies

### **Low Ground (Tarps)**
- **Advantages:** Harder to spot, easier to rotate, less exposed
- **Disadvantages:** Limited vision, harder to escape, vulnerable to storm
- **Best Use:** When you need to rotate, when storm is closing
- **Materials Needed:** 500-800 materials for basic coverage

### **Mid Ground (Builds)**
- **Advantages:** Good vision, escape options, strategic positioning
- **Disadvantages:** Exposed to multiple angles, material intensive
- **Best Use:** When you have materials, when you need to control area
- **Materials Needed:** 800-1200 materials for solid positioning

### **High Ground (Towers)**
- **Advantages:** Best vision, control over area, escape options
- **Disadvantages:** Material intensive, exposed to snipers, hard to maintain
- **Best Use:** When you have excess materials, when you need to control endgame
- **Materials Needed:** 1200+ materials for full tower

### **Layer Selection Decision Tree**
1. **How many materials do you have?**
   - <500: Low ground only
   - 500-800: Low to mid ground
   - 800-1200: Mid ground with options
   - 1200+: All layers available

2. **What's your current position?**
   - Storm edge: Low ground for rotation
   - Center zone: Mid ground for control
   - High ground: Maintain if you have materials

3. **How many players remain?**
   - 20+: Low to mid ground (save materials)
   - 10-19: Mid ground (balanced approach)
   - <10: High ground if you have materials

## üèÜ C6S4 CONSOLE VICTORY CASH CUP üèÜ

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Rules ‚ÑπÔ∏è 
- **Format:** Duos
- **Region Lock:** No Region Lock
- **Matchmaking:** ELO (points-based matchmaking)

### üìä Points System üìä
- **Win:** 65 points (points start at Top 25)
- **Elimination:** 2 points
- **Note:** Similar to current Trios points systems
- **Strategy:** Elims are worth double compared to Div 2 or 3 Cups, but duos format means fewer elims on average

### ü§î Tournament Strategy ü§î 
**For Top 500 on EU/NAC:**
- **DO NOT have to key** (aggressive early fighting)
- **Placement Strategy:** Duos around Top 500 on EU last season averaged:
  - Total elims: 38
  - Max elims in a game: 15
  - Many full placement teams qualified with <20 elims total

**Recommendation:** If you're not 100% confident about keying and winning 90%+ of your fights, just play placement. Really good consistent placement will move you up towards qualification by the end.

**Tool:** Use ü§ñtourney-calc-pro during the tournament to calculate what you need to do in the rest of the tourney to qualify

### üî´ Loadout üî´
**Shotgun:** Sentinel Pump is the best shotgun, unless you have used the revolver a lot and are really confident that you love it.

**AR:** In stacked lobbies where you need a lot of surge, take the OXR Rifle. But for most players that don't need surge or only need 200 damage, the Hammer or Fury AR is the better choice for its increased boxfighting ability.

**Mobility:** Crash Pads. Launch Pads as a backup if you don't get crash pads. 1 stack of crash pads should be enough, but if you're worried about it, you can both take crash pads.

**Heals:** Take 2 heals. Legendary slurps are the best heals so if you get 2, you'll always be taking that. Splashes and Fizz are next best. You always want a fizz in your team so you can combo with mobility items. If you still have more space after those options, then med kits, minis, bigs, and med mist are all about equal in value.

# BOON COMBOS BY PLAYSTYLE

## ‚öñÔ∏è BALANCED (HYBRID) PLAYSTYLE
**Goal:** Stay versatile ‚Äî able to fight but also survive rotations.

**Optimal Boon Combination:**
- **Storm Forecast** ‚Üí Lets you pre-plan rotations and avoid wasted mats
- **Extended Magazine** ‚Üí More ammo = fewer reloads in midgame and endgame sprays
- **Agile Aiming** ‚Üí Keeps your accuracy steady across fights

**Why it works:** Gives you consistent damage output while also letting you rotate smartly. Perfect for hybrid players who adapt based on the lobby.

## üó°Ô∏è AGGRESSIVE (W-KEY) PLAYSTYLE
**Goal:** Dominate fights, keep pressure, and rack up elims.

**Optimal Boon Combination:**
- **Agile Aiming** ‚Üí Helps in box fights and high-stress close-range trades
- **Extended Magazine** ‚Üí Lets you spray walls and force edits without reloading
- **Super Soldier** ‚Üí Infinite sprint = chase down enemies, control height quickly

**Why it works:** You'll always be moving fast, applying pressure, and trading efficiently ‚Äî essential for fraggers and solo clutch players.

## üõ°Ô∏è SAFE (PLACEMENT/SURVIVAL) PLAYSTYLE
**Goal:** Outlast others, play storm smart, and win through placement.

**Optimal Boon Combination:**
- **Storm Forecast** ‚Üí Best defensive boon, ensures you're always ahead of zone
- **Super Soldier** ‚Üí Infinite sprint means guaranteed rotation options when mats are low
- **Carapace Medallion synergy** (if secured) ‚Üí Free passive healing stacks perfectly with safe playstyle

**Why it works:** You minimize risk, waste fewer resources, and always stay one step ahead in zone ‚Äî ideal for IGLs or passive players who prioritize placement points.

## ‚ö° QUICK RECAP
- **Balanced** = Storm Forecast + Extended Mag + Agile Aiming
- **Aggressive** = Agile Aiming + Extended Mag + Super Soldier
- **Safe** = Storm Forecast + Super Soldier (+ Carapace Medallion if possible)

// MYTHIC & MEDALLION COUNTERS
export const mythicCounters = `
# MYTHIC & MEDALLION COUNTERS

## üó°Ô∏è MYTHIC WEAPON MATCHUPS

### Enhanced Wrecker Revolver
**Key Strengths:** Close-range burst, shotgun-level damage
**Counter Strategies:** Use distance: Pull back, spam builds; counter with Hammer/Fury AR to punish reload

### O.X.R. Assault Rifle
**Key Strengths:** Mid-range consistent DPS
**Counter Strategies:** Box up, force close-range fight; avoid open ground; prioritize cover and aim assist boons

### Sweeper Shotgun
**Key Strengths:** High burst, 1v1 duels
**Counter Strategies:** Keep distance; force shotgun swap by holding walls; use Fizz + launch pads to disengage

## üèÜ MYTHIC MEDALLION SPAWN INFO

### Carapace Medallion
**Spawn Locations:** Mid-to-late zone POIs, high loot areas
**Reward:** +3 shields/sec (passive heal)
**Risk:** Early fights can be contested heavily; delayed pickup may cost rotations

### Springleg Medallion
**Spawn Locations:** High-ground POIs, mountain edges
**Reward:** Double jump mobility
**Risk:** Often exposed while collecting; can be picked off mid-fight

### Surge Medallion
**Spawn Locations:** Hot POIs, mid-zone
**Reward:** Burst mobility for rotations/fights
**Risk:** Aggressive players may contest; mobility can be wasted if overused

## ‚öñÔ∏è RISK VS REWARD GUIDANCE

### Carapace
- **Risk Level:** Low if early fights are avoided
- **Best For:** Placement-oriented or balanced players

### Springleg
- **Risk Level:** Medium
- **Best For:** Players who can secure high ground safely; gives huge mobility advantage but exposes you to peak-height fights

### Surge
- **Risk Level:** High if grabbed in hot POIs
- **Best For:** Aggressive rotations and chase-downs; rewards calculated aggression

## ü§ñ AI INTEGRATION LOGIC
**Check player archetype (Aggressive / Balanced / Safe) and recommend medallion pick based on:**
- Playstyle (aggressive = Surge/Springleg; safe = Carapace)
- Zone timing (early/mid/late)
- POI traffic (avoid contested drops)

**Offer matchup advice for any enemy with mythic:**
- Example: "Enemy has O.X.R. AR ‚Üí Keep walls up, use Fizz + pads to reposition"
- Calculate risk/reward score to help players decide whether to contest or skip a medallion

// MOBILITY SYSTEM & ROTATION STRATEGY
export const mobilityStrategy = `
# MOBILITY SYSTEM & ROTATION STRATEGY

## üöÄ ROTATION DECISION-MAKING: WHEN TO HOLD VS BURN MOBILITY

### Early Game (POI to Zone 1)
- **Hold Mobility:** If safe, avoid early Fizz/Crash Pad use
- **Burn Mobility:** If late in circle or contested, use immediately
- **Strategy:** Preserve for mid/late fights or rotations

### Mid Game (Zone 2‚Äì3)
- **Hold Mobility:** If you have natural high ground or shield advantage
- **Burn Mobility:** To rotate to advantageous high ground or loot
- **Note:** Aggressive players may force rotations anyway

### Endgame (Final 2‚Äì3 zones)
- **Hold Mobility:** Only if already in safe spot with control
- **Burn Mobility:** Fizz/Launch Pads for height swaps, flank, or rotate around opponents
- **Strategy:** Endgame often requires forced mobility to win fights

### Surge / Storm Threat
- **Hold Mobility:** If zone prediction already favors you
- **Burn Mobility:** To rotate early if storm forecast predicts unsafe path
- **Key:** Zone mechanics + Storm Forecast boon critical

### Chasing/Engaging Opponents
- **Hold Mobility:** If opponent has limited mobility
- **Burn Mobility:** To chase enemies, close distance quickly
- **Enhancement:** Super Soldier boon + Surge Medallion combo enhances chase potential

**Key Principle:** Mobility is a limited resource; always weigh immediate advantage vs future options

## üó∫Ô∏è MAP-SPECIFIC MOBILITY CHOKE POINTS

### Hot POIs
**Choke Point:** Central roads, bridge entries, elevated ramps
**Mobility Tips:** Use Fizz or Crash Pads to bypass traffic & rotate safely

### High Ground Zones
**Choke Point:** Mountain tops, cliff edges, zip lines
**Mobility Tips:** Launch Pads or Springleg medallion to quickly contest or escape

### Open Fields / Deadside
**Choke Point:** Wide plains, open water crossings
**Mobility Tips:** Burn mobility early or use Surge to minimize storm exposure

### Urban POIs
**Choke Point:** Tight streets, building clusters
**Mobility Tips:** Use vertical mobility (Jump Pads, Fizz) to avoid ambushes and get roof advantage

### Endgame Ring
**Choke Point:** Low-ground traps, tunnel-like valley paths
**Mobility Tips:** Prioritize mobility combos (Fizz + Pads) to flank or reposition quickly

## ü§ñ AI INTEGRATION LOGIC

**Input:** Player location, inventory (mobility items/boons), zone position, nearby threats

**Decision Tree:**
- If holding high ground + safe ‚Üí advise hold mobility
- If contested / late zone ‚Üí advise burn mobility, choose optimal path based on choke points

**Map-Specific Alerts:** Notify player when approaching mobility choke points and suggest best tool combo (Fizz + Crash Pads, Launch Pads + Super Soldier, etc.)

**Integration:** Combine with Storm Forecast boon + Medallions for a full rotation score: "High risk ‚Üí Burn mobility now" or "Safe ‚Üí Save for endgame"

**Note:** These averages can vary depending on tournament format (duos, trios) and point scoring system (win = X pts, elim = Y pts)

## üéØ OPPONENT ARCHETYPE BREAKDOWN

### Lower-Ranked Players
**Common Behavior:** Passive, predictable rotations, low-build fights
**Counter Tips:** Use mobility to control engagement; capitalize on mistakes; zone control

### Mid-Ranked Players
**Common Behavior:** Mixed aggression, decent build usage
**Counter Tips:** Avoid early full engagement; pick fights selectively; track elims

### High-Ranked Players
**Common Behavior:** Aggressive, high build skill, fast edits
**Counter Tips:** Use boons/meds to counter rushes; maintain distance; anticipate rotations; watch for predictable drop patterns

### Pro-Level / FNCS Tier
**Common Behavior:** High game sense, optimized rotations, aggressive + placement balance
**Counter Tips:** Play around meta; track points and rotations carefully; prioritize high-value fights; leverage mobility & zone knowledge

**Key Principle:** Player behavior scales with rank‚ÄîPathGen can predict likely aggression, rotation choices, and engagement windows based on opponent division
