## üí° **Example AI Responses**

**User:** "Where should I land for high loot but not too much competition?"

**AI Response:** "Based on the EU server data, I'd recommend **Martial Maneuvers** or **Rocky Rus**. They offer 9300 loot with 1600 metal, but only 1.24 average teams. The 62% survival rate is excellent for the loot you'll get. Plus, they're in Zones 3 and 6, so you can use guaranteed zone positioning strategies..."

**User:** "I need lots of metal for building, where should I go?"

**AI Response:** "For maximum metal, **First Order Base** is your best bet with 10,000 metal! It's in Zone 4 with very low competition (0.48 avg teams). **Rogue Slurp Room Market** is another great option with 9600 metal and a 63% survival rate. Both are excellent for building-intensive strategies..."
