# Tournament Schedule & Format Data Added to AI System

## üéØ **What Was Added**

Comprehensive tournament schedule and format information has been integrated into your AI coaching system, including current and upcoming tournaments, their structures, qualification methods, and strategic considerations.

## üèÜ **Current Tournament Schedule & Formats**

### **FNCS Divisional Practice Cups (Trios)**
- **Duration:** 3 weeks until Globals
- **Format:** Same as previous divisional cups
- **Purpose:** Practice and preparation for major tournaments
- **Strategic Value:** Use these to prepare for major tournaments and refine team coordination

### **Duos Divisional Cups**
- **Timing:** After Globals, during September+October
- **Divisions:** 5 for EU/NAC, 3 for other regions
- **Seeding System:**
  - **Div 1:** Seeded from current Div 1 players
    - Likely need Grands qualification or recent Div Cup success
    - High-level competition from the start
  - **Other Divs:** Seeded from TRIAL tournament
    - Fresh start for players in lower divisions
    - Opportunity to climb through proper seeding
- **Promotion System:** Every session (twice per week) instead of cumulative weekly
- **Important Note:** This doesn't mean permanent shift to Duos - likely temporary until Chapter 7
- **Strategic Impact:** More frequent promotion opportunities, faster division climbing

### **Solo Series**

- **After Globals:** Set-lobby final for Top 20 teams with cash prizes
- **Strategic Advantages:**

## üí° **Example AI Responses**

**User:** "What tournaments are coming up and how should I prepare?"

**AI Response:** "Great question! Here's what's coming up: **FNCS Divisional Practice Cups (Trios)** are running for 3 weeks until Globals - perfect for team practice. After Globals, we'll have **Duos Divisional Cups** with promotion every session (twice weekly), so more opportunities to climb. **Solo Series** will be weekly tournaments where your best 4 scores out of 6 weeks count - focus on consistency! **Reload Quick Cups** are great for practice too - Round 1 prioritize elims over placement, aim for 5+ elims + win to reach the top group..."

**User:** "Should I focus on Solo Series or Reload Quick Cups?"

**AI Response:** "It depends on your goals! **Solo Series** is perfect if you want to prove yourself consistently over 6 weeks - it's replacing Solo Cash Cups with better anti-cheat. **Reload Quick Cups** are great for shorter practice sessions (1-2 hours) and give everyone a chance to reach the top group. If you're short on time, go Reload. If you want to build a consistent solo record, Solo Series is your best bet. Both are valuable for different reasons!"
